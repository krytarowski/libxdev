/*******************************************
 libudev example.

 This example prints out properties of
 each of the hidraw devices. It then
 creates a monitor which will report when
 hidraw devices are connected or removed
 from the system.

 This code is meant to be a teaching
 resource. It can be used for anyone for
 any reason, including embedding into
 a commercial product.
